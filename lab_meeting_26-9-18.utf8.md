#Background
##Project

Examine the effect of regeneration on the molecular age profile of *Parhyale* limbs

##Designing codeset

*Nanostring as method to quantify gene expression

*200 genes in codeset

-195 genes chosen on the basis of differential expression analysis 

-5 control genes: do not vary in expression between conditions


#Age-length relationship



#Building an age-length model


#Model performance

#Young vs old separation
Using age classes: old vs young (plus middle)

#Multiple Regression approach
##Model overfitting

####Simple linear regression: 

**Age = X(marker1) + c**

We try to find values for x & c that come as close as possible to solving the equation for each set of values for *Age* and *marker1* we have. 

####Two predictors:

**Age = X(marker1) + Y(marker2) + c**

####Many predictors

**Age = X(marker1) + Y(marker2) + Z(marker3) + W(marker4) + .... + c**


Where we have many different markers, we can find values of x,y,z,w, etc that solve this equation very well, not because we
